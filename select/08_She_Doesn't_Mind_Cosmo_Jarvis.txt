Mum and Dad, I met a girl
And she's got great teeth and she's marrying me
And she's a great cook
And she's about to finish writing her fifth book
Mum and dad, she paints as well
She wrote her own theory of relativity
It's better than Einstein's, oh and she's all mine
Mum and dad, I love her more
Than I've ever loved anything
And you should hear her sing, she's got a record deal
And if she leaves me I won't heal
Mum and dad, she found a way
To put an end to global warming
During our breakfast just this morning
She's getting a Nobel Prize
She's the best damn woman alive
And she doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
She doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
She says she doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
She doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
She doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
Mum and dad, I met a girl
She says she's gunna be my wife and complete my life
She's got a science degree
We fell in love at university
Mum and dad, this one's got brains
And she's so damn smart, knows Shakespeare off by heart
Her dad's a doctor
So glad I got her
Mum and dad, she's an active member of Greenpeace
She's from an educated home
And she plays the trombone
Makes my heart tingle
And she's trilingual
Mum and dad, she's curing cancer
And you can meet next week
She's coming down to make a speech on stem cells
I think the wedding is gunna go well
And she doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
She doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
She says she doesn't mind the oh, oh, oh, she doesn't mind the
